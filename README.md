# 🖥️ Operating Systems – Practiced C Programs  
A collection of solved Operating System (OS) concepts implemented in **C programming language**.  
This repository serves as my personal practice archive, containing solutions to classic OS problems, process scheduling algorithms, memory management techniques, file allocation methods, inter-process communication, synchronization, and more.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
This repository is designed to help students and developers understand practical OS concepts by implementing them in C.  
Every program focuses on **logic clarity**, **working examples**, and **topic-wise explanation**.
